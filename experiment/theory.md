The triaxial compression test is a more sophisticated test procedure for determining the shear strength of soil because we can measure both drained as well as undrained shear strength.

Generally 1.4” diameter (3” tall) or 2.8” diameter (6” tall) specimen is used. Specimen is encased by a thin rubber membrane and set inside a plastic cylindrical chamber. Cell pressure is applied in the chamber (which represents σ<sub>3</sub>) by pressurizing the cell fluid (generally water).Vertical stress is increased by loading the specimen (by raising the platen in strain controlled test and by adding loads directly in stress controlled test, but strain controlled test is more common) until shear failure occurs. Total vertical stress (σ<sub>1</sub>) is equal to the sum of σ<sub>3</sub> and deviator stress (σ<sub>d</sub>). Measurement of σ<sub>d</sub>, axial deformation, pore pressure and sample volume change are recorded. 

Depending on the nature of loading and drainage condition, triaxial tests are conducted in three different ways.
1. UU Triaxial test
2. CU Triaxial test
3. CD Triaxial test

UU triaxial test gives shear strength of soil at different confining stresses. Shear strength is important in all types of geotechnical designs and analyses.
